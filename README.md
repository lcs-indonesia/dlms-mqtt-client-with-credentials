# 🧩 DLMS MQTT Client with Credentials

A modified version of the **Gurux DLMS MQTT client** that adds support for **username and password authentication** when connecting to an MQTT broker.

This project allows secure DLMS/COSEM data exchange via MQTT with brokers that require login credentials, while keeping backward compatibility with unauthenticated connections.
